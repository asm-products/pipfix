        What is PipFix?    
    </div>
    When you search a movie on IMDB you get an
    average of all the users' votes. This average
    tends to be useless because it has nothing to do
    with you and/or your interests. On PipFix what
    you get will be only the average of people that
    you follow. Using this weighted average the
    service will give you a collection of useful
    information based on your followed users input.
